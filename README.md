Time Gloves are gloves that can freeze any moving object

It will emit bright, fixed-frequency (but adjustable) light from the palm to target objects.

When the light frequency matches the frequency of moving objects (rotating or vibrating), moving objects will look like freezed (time stop)!

### Code

I have upload my whole OpenSTM32 project (**/timegloves-openstm32-project**)

The main logic code is inside **src/main.c** and **inc/\***
